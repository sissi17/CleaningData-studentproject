Summary of made choices:
========================
For this tidy data preparation, 
-both training (70% of randomly selected volunteers' observations, n = 7352) and test (30 % of randomly selected volunteers' observations, n = 2947) sets were merged to create o single data set (n = 10299 observations).
-we selected to keep only 66 of the 561 "original" variables (see below), corresponding to those calculating the mean and standard deviation for each measurement estimated from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals.
-descriptive activity (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) and variables names were used to name the activities or label the tidy data set.
-the tidy data set summarizes the data, grouped by ID testers and activities, displaying the average of each of these 66 variables (mean and standard deviation variables) for each activity and each ID Volunteer. Each variable is in one labeled column. The average of each different observations of that variable () is in a different row.


"initial" Variables/Features of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Version 1.0) 
======================================================================================================
The "original" 561 features selected for the Human Activity Recognition using smartphones datasets came from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

The complete list and full description of "original" variables is available at the site : 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
See also references and source (below). 
For each record it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


Design of the initial experiment: 
==================================
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.
